### **Alcohol or sugar?**

Alcohol is present in our lives, whether we like it or not.

Because everyone talks about it, it's always offered, it's in movies, ads, etc.

I don't drink it.

Don't congratulate me, I've never wanted to.

I know some people who are addicted though. At different levels, so I consider myself lucky not to have had this curse.

Now comes the moment when some people will hate me for saying this:
Sugar is also worse than alcohol.

It's very different, but at the same time very similar.

I'm addicted to sugar.

I don't really know anyone who is addicted to alcohol, AND sugar.

So no one to defend me.

But I think it's the same mechanism.

Can't hold back from having more, after the first one?
Do you want more if you're deprived of it?
Even if you can stop, the taste never goes away?

Yes, sugar and alcohol.

The biggest difference is that sugar has much less visible negative effects in the short term.

Visible.
In the short term.

In the long term, both are very bad for you.

Anyway, I understand if you don't believe me, but even if I've never had any semblance of an addiction to alcohol.
I know what it's like.
And I'm not alone.

Let's all be more tolerant of others, no one has the same battles.
