### **If I were to have a Ted Talk**

I would talk about how the agriculture is dying because of industrialization and capitalism.

Farmers want to make money, so they make crops that have subventions from the government, but know it's not sustainable and would not do that without the money incentives.

Partly because they have to put more and more pesticides every year.

They're killing the soil, and just some rain (slightly more than usual) can completely wreck their whole fields.

Only having some green manure would remove that issue.

That, and having an actual ecosystem.

Like regenerative agriculture.

Agriculture should make the land better, not worse.

We don't even necessarily need to eat less meat, just eat less meat that is done in an unsustainable way.

In a way that doesn't destroys the environment.

Nature did the whole thing, we don't need to reinvent it, we are pretty bad at it already.
