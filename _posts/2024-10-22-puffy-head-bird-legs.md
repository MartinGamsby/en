### **Puffy head, bird legs**

"Puffy head, bird legs" is when astronauts get too much blood in their head, and not enough in their legs.

Because we have evolved to work with gravity, so our heart closer to the top of our body, since the bool is usually countered by gravity, but it's not slowed down in micro gravity.

You can't just "hang" them, obviously, since there's no gravity, but what if you spin the astronaut, with the head in the center, wouldn't centrifugal force make an effect similar to earth's gravity? 

I'm not saying make the whole station turn, that would be crazy hard to do.

No, not always, but only on the astronaut, at least a few times while in space to reduce the effects of microgravity.

Maybe the astronauts can even power it themselves. A small bicycle-like mechanism to make it turn, exercising at the same time (also much needed under micro gravity).
