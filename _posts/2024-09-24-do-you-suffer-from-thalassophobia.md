### **Do you suffer from Thalassophobia?**

Sometimes I see images that should:

- inspire
- motivate
- make you think
- or just be "beautiful"

But for me, they create anxiety.

Not all of them, no, I'm talking about the ones that are in the water.

We all have different fears, to different degrees.

We can't think that something will please everyone.

And that's okay.

Nothing pleases everyone.
