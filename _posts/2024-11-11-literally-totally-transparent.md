### **Literally, totally transparent,**

new banks were built.

Banks have trust issues. People are becoming more aware of manipulation and lack of transparency.

Banks can give at least 10x what they were given, so you couldn't take it all out at once.

New banks were opened: just a bunch of money, inside a safe made of tempered glass.

That way you can see what's inside.

A ton of new customers invested.

### But what they don't know 

is that they also made simpler versions with just a window, not a full box, and that window...

It was replaced by a screen that shows a record of money that doesn't exist anymore.

The manipulation will still be there, what were you thinking...
