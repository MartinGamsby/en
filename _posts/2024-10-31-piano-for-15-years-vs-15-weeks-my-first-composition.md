### **Piano for 15 years vs 15 weeks - My first composition**

I started doing "real" piano (learning an actual piece) 15 years ago.

I learned it by heart in 3 weeks.

And since then, I've been playing it once in a while, learning a song once in a while, without much progress.

A few months ago, I started taking piano classes, and after ~15 weeks of 0 to 2 hours of practice and theory per week, I just made my first composition.

I thought it would be much longer.

And it's not super good, but I UNDERSTAND it, and that's a great feeling, and many more to come.
