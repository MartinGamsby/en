### **I'm afraid of soup**

Today I was making noodle soup for my daughters, then I got a drop of broth in my eye.

After a few seconds, I felt my face swelling and I started having difficulty breathing. For a few hours. After a few minutes, I started to feel less in my fingers, then my whole body. For a few hours.

I had a little trouble walking straight, my legs felt heavy. I scraped my fingers a little more than usual, sometimes they shook. I was also a little dizzy. I felt like lying in bed (and I did).

But I'm used to all that. Normally this is when I eat gluten. Now if I eat foods with traces of gluten too. And apparently, if I don't eat it too, but simply if I get a drop of broth in my eye. When I eat it, I also get nausea, headaches, and so on.

At some point, for 2 weeks, I didn't feel anything. Not emotionally, but I didnâ€™t feel my skin. I didn't feel hungry or thirsty either. I forgot to drink and got massive headaches because of it...

Anyway, I injured myself a lot, but I was mostly worried.

Because I didn't know why.

The doctors were as useless as they were difficult to contact. And I saw several.

About 5-10% of people are negatively affected by gluten, to varying degrees. I hit the jackpot, but for those who have weaker symptoms, it can do damage in the long run. And the worst thing is that few people know about it, and there is gluten everywhere.

All this to say that anyone who thinks that gluten is just a fad, it's time to change your mind.

Yes, Karen may be eating gluten-free for the sake of the trend, but there is a real problem hidden behind this fad. And it's not just "a stomach ache" or some ridiculous little symptoms.
