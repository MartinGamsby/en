### **Why 80% of wealth belongs to 20% of people, and why it matters for everything**

What is the connection between wealth and learning, you might ask?

I could tell you that with the help of the advice I give you, you will have the opportunity to make a lot of money: by landing the best jobs after an interview, scholarships, etc.

However, this is not why I am writing this post.

Here is why:

It is a fact: 80% of people have, together, a quarter of what the other 20% have, but it is not only for money! For anything…:

### A little-known law

Have you ever heard of Pareto’s law?

According to the observations of Vilfredo Pareto, a renowned Italian economist and sociologist, “Pareto’s law” states that:

* 20% of countries own 80% of the world’s wealth.
* 20% of the inhabitants of a country own 80% of the country's wealth.
* 20% of the neighborhood owns 80% of the city's wealth.
* ...  you get the principle?

In short, 20% of people have 80% of the money. It should be noted that this is not an exact figure, it is an average, but all the real figures are so close to these theoretical figures that it is almost disturbing.

For example, 19% can own 75%, or 21% own 82% for example ... But only money?

Absolutely not, and that’s what makes this law so beautiful: it applies everywhere:

* For the number of people with money
* For the number of efforts to achieve a goal
* For the number of customers demanding service
* For the number of products compared to turnover
* For the number of people with talent
* For … luck?

### Defy the law

Luck is just an illusion. A concept. An invention.

Things happen when they happen, it’s up to you to decide what you do with them…

If you fail, it’s because you weren’t well prepared, or not motivated enough.

If you succeed, it’s not luck, it’s because you did what had to be done, and you seized the opportunities that were available to you, which you wouldn’t have seen if you didn’t REALLY want to achieve your goal.

This is why 20% of people own 80% of everything that exists: they REALLY want it.

If, overnight, all the wealth in the world was divided equally, a few years, or even a few months, would be enough for 80% of the wealth to go to 20% of the people who had it before.

For one simple reason: luck does not exist.

You have to create your luck, and do what you have to do to succeed in what you want to succeed in.

I give you this advice for life in general, because with this concept you can do much more than just learn what you want to learn.

but the most important thing: you can learn anything, simply by REALLY wanting it.

It is not by thinking about becoming rich that you become rich, it is by REALLY wanting it.

It is not by thinking about learning something that you learn it, it is by REALLY wanting it.

Logically, the rest will come by itself, but I will still continue to give you some other tips to save you time.

So good luck, if you still believe in luck!
