### **10 years!**

I started writing a novel, in the bus, 10 years ago.

Every day, I wrote a small piece, and after about 2 years, I finally finished it.

So 8 years ago, what did I do with it?

Not much ...

Should I dust it off now?

It was before the pandemic, before the explosion of artificial intelligence, and before Neuralink (I'm mentioning it because it is very relevant to the subject of the novel).

It's a little outdated now ... :(
