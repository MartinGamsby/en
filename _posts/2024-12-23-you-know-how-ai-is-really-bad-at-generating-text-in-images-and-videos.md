### **You know how AI is really bad at generating text in images and videos?**

I just thought...

It's kind of like kids.

They can understand the world reaaaally well, in a very short amount of time. They can't draw like AI, but I bet their dreams are like current AI videos.

Kids can't write. They can write gibberish letters though.

Like AI.

What we're witnessing is the dreams of kid AIs.

With a much larger brain than kids.

And flawless memory.

Let's just hope they don't become teenagers ...
