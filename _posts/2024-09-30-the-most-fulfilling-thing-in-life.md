### **The most fulfilling thing in life**

Dan Koe said "You can feel the pull. Towards something more. Your mind craves it. Unplug. Reset. Treat tomorrow like it's the first day of your new life. [...]"

Let me add:

And if you ever feel the urge to go back, do nothing.

That doesn't mean losing the battle. That means literally doing nothing.

Stare at the wall if necessary. Take a walk if it's too much for you.

Your bored mind will find something meaningful to do towards that something more
