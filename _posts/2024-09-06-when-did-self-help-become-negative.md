### **When did self-help become negative?**

I recently heard that the answers to beautifying our society should be collective, not individual.

I can see that.

But when it becomes 
#### "hustle culture", it becomes a problem.

I still think that we can’t make good societal changes without being ourselves at a certain level.

Wanting to be the best for yourself at all costs is not the goal. The goal is to be the best you can be, for OTHERS. You have to be at your best to help, and everyone will be better off.

#### Maybe what’s missing is
the combination of the two.

I sometimes hear that you have to forget about others to work for yourself, and that sucks.

I also hear, however, that you have to help others at all costs, and that sucks too.

I saw a video of someone who was 
#### taking drugs to get bigger muscles. 
He knew it was going to destroy his life, but he wanted to "look cut", which is not only useless for others, but it's also bad for him.

We should talk about both sides: we must help ourselves to help, we must help to help ourselves.

#### Sometimes by helping others, we help ourselves.

But the opposite is also true.

As in all spheres of life, everything must be done in moderation. The balance of the whole is more important than the strength of each aspect.
