### **No, it's time for winter coats and boots**

The days of waiting for boots in stores are over, just because you're trying to tell us otherwise.

Winter clothes season is winter.

You can get them beforehand, but we need them during winter.

And to all the salespeople saying it’s not the right time and trying to make us feel bad—stop.

It’s pointless.

We still need them anyway.

Because our kids' feet grew too fast.

Because the boots are lost.

Because the coat is ruined.

There are PLENTY of reasons.

Not just because we're late.

And if you actually listened to people, you'd have more winter clothes in stock, and your customers wouldn't have to go elsewhere.

Just because you’re not selling them doesn’t mean we won’t pay someone else online.

So, clothing stores: go take a chhhh…ocolate
