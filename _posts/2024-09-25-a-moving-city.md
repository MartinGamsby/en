### **A moving city**

What if cities were on a "threadmill" / conveyor belts?

Let me explain:

A part of the city is on a platform  that can move. Not all the time, but periodically.

For example, schools move every year.

That way, families don't change houses, and the school comes to them.

The high school comes to them.

And so on.

But we can apply this to other things too:

We could have a slower row (like schools) and a faster row.
The shops would change every week.

That would make it possible to discover new places, without having to go far, in front of your house!

There would be the problem of people working at these rolling shops, but we could just have an apartment above, like we did before.

By the way, if you didn't already know, the suburbs with rows of houses, without shops or anything, it was an experiment, and it's a failure, we have to stop that...

(This morning I was thinking about the school buses that go and pick up all these children.)

Obviously, it's not practical, it's just an exercise!
