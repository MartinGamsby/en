### **The secret to feeling better, always at hand**

Are you feeling good, right now?

No matter what your answer is, I can guess what it is, by asking you another question: how were you feeling, a minute ago?

And it's probably the same thing.

If you feel good right now, same thing a minute ago.

If you don't feel good right now, same thing a minute ago.

Well, why do I say that?

Because your current state depends on... your previous state.

It's simple, right?

Every little decision you make has an impact on your current state.
And therefore on your future state.

Again, it's quite simple, but so... it makes so much sense.
No matter your current state, you just have to improve it, a little bit, to be able to feel better (a lot).

One decision at a time.

Always one at a time.
