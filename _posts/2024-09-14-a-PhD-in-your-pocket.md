### **A PhD in your pocket**

Yesterday, ChatGPT released their new model.

It thinks before answering.

I have always been saying that LLMs are doing our "fast thinking" equivalent. It makes mistakes, like us.

But now OpenAI also started doing the "slow thinking" part.

And let me make a prediction: in a few weeks (days?) nobody will care, it's going to become the norm, and a "PhD in your pocket" will not be impressive to anyone (except me!)

Every time there's a new milestone, people think of a reason why it's not a big deal, even though a year ago they said that THAT would be impressive.

The bar always gets higher.

Avoidance?
Fear?
Stupidity?
