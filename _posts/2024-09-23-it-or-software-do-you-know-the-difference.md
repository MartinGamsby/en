### **IT or software. Do you know the difference?**

It happened again: Someone thought that I was in IT.

I'm not it IT. I do software.

If you don't know how to say it.
Or if you don't know the difference.

#### Here's a taxi analogy

Let's compare computers with taxis.

There's a taxi driver.

That taxi driver is working in software (using the taxi / computer)

#### If his taxi breaks...
He might know why (or not)
He might know how to fix small things (or not)
He might do regular maintenance himself (or not)

Same thing for software developers:
#### If his computer breaks (or his printer)
He might know why (or not)
He might know how to fix small things (or not)
He might do regular maintenance himself (or not)

#### IT is the mechanic
A taxi driver with a broken taxi takes it to the mechanic.
Even if he might be able to change his oil (or not), a mechanic knows what's up, it's their job.

If a developer has a broken computer, he takes it to IT.
Even if he might be able to fix some issues (or not), an IT knows what's up, it's their job.

So the next time you get asked for some IT stuff, start with that analogy.
(And them perhaps look at them not listening and asking you to fix it again)
