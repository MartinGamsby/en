### **(NOT) Drop out of school, use Google instead?**

I admit I agree... a little.

(I saw someone say this today: School is useless, use Google, because the best is EXPERIENCE.)

Let's start with the easy part: yes, it's better to become a salesperson than to study sales.

At least for ~99% of people.

Same thing for several jobs.

But to say that school is useless, then no.

I can go to the extreme: no need to go to school to be a hairdresser, go learn it with a real hairdresser.

ok... I can understand.

But how will she do it, if she can't read?

Or count?

Is she going to have to rely on someone for all that?

And this person, did she go to school?

Okay, I'm talking about primary and secondary school here.

Let's grant him this nuance, not so nuanced in fact: school is broad...

So let's talk about post-secondary school.

Yes, school has been pushed too far. It's not because we go to post-secondary school that we're going to be better at our first job, or even better conditions.

But some jobs, some careers need school.

I don't want my doctor to learn on Google.

I don't want our bridges to be made by trial and error.

And as a software developer who studied 7 years of post-secondary education, I see that there are jobs that are gray areas.

Yes, you can make prototypes quickly without going to university to learn to "code".

But I learned a ton of things in school that I use every day.

I couldn't have learned all this through experience, or at least it would have taken a lifetime to learn it.

And I don't want to educate someone on something that is known, that could easily be learned in school.

I'll rephrase what this person is saying:

Before you consider higher education, check if it makes sense to go there.

Maybe you can go faster.

Maybe not.

Maybe if you go faster, it will come back to haunt you very soon.

Everyone is different.

All jobs are different.

No one's circumstances are the same.

Stop generalizing.

And as the other one would say: The only thing that is constant is change.
