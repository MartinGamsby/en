### **Gandalf reconciled me with life**

Myers-Briggs is a pseudoscience, which puts humanity in 16 boxes. Four categories, two choices per category, that gives 16 personalities with 4 letters. I won't go into the details of "pseudoscience", but let's say that I identify with INTPs.

Some famous INTPs are: Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin, Abraham Lincoln and Marie Curie. Some famous FICTIONAL INTPs are: Sherlock Holmes, Neo (The Matrix), and Gandalf.

Since it's not scientific (and because it's hard for everyone to understand different personalities), there is some conflict over whether the personalities of these celebrities are true, but whatever, I just want to say that we have things in common. No one is the same, obviously.

So I would be similar to Gandalf, personality-wise. So I don’t do magic (although some people think that programming is magic, but it’s not, actually…). But personality is a way of thinking.

Gandalf is rather reserved, in the sense that he does not speak for nothing. But he knows things… And can apply them. If there is an emergency (e.g. the end of the world), he knows what to do. If he has to, he will become a leader, although that is not his default style. He prefers to make fireworks once in a while, if possible. And it’s precisely the fireworks that I want to talk about.

For those who don't know, Gandalf is not human. He's a sort of demigod in the world of Lord of the Rings. A Maia.

So Gandalf is immortal. But what is Gandalf doing? He's making... Fireworks!

He can do magic a hundred times stronger and more impressive, he knows almost everything.

Yet (when the world is not in danger) he pleases the hobbits by making fireworks...

And that makes him happy.

And that's it.
