### **Programming, a love-hate relationship? (Not just programming)**

Have you ever tried programming?

Have you ever hated a language?

(The image says: “I hate myself,” then the self-hating person is shown: “c++” [a programming language], and they say “Wow! I hate that even more!”)

Personally, I never hated C++.

I found it fascinating.

I don't know if it's because it was one of the first programming languages ​​I learned, or because the others I learned before were even lower level. 

Still, I've never hated C++, or really any other real programming language I've tried (yes, there are languages ​​that aren't “real”, for example I hate brainfuck).

On the other hand, I found it difficult.

Because I didn't understand everything. Because I didn't know everything. 

I think that's the similarity between hating yourself, and hating a programming language.

We don't know it well at first.

Maybe if you hate yourself... You don’t know yourself very well? 

Getting to know yourself puts things into perspective. 

And there's always more to learn, try it.
