### **No data on my phone this morning, disaster?**

I have 1h40 of public transport to do.

At first, I admit that I said to myself this: Disaster!

But why?

I took the bus for years without a phone.

And years without data.

I never needed it...

#### Why do I want it now?

I can pass the time by writing this text, but maybe I should take advantage of the opportunity to stop.

To think.

It's something we don't do much these days.

Even our ancestors, who had to work very long hours, did tasks that are relatively simple.

Simple enough to be able to think at the same time.

To be able to process emotions, events.

This simple action, of letting our thoughts go... Could greatly reduce the number of mental health problems. Like burnout, anxiety...

It's a lot like meditation, even if it's not exactly the same thing...

#### The important thing is that it's regular.

Like most things too, the important thing is to go one at a time.

One meditation, or one period of thinking, at a time.

Each time we see more benefits.
Each time we become better.
Alright, I'm going back to my train without data, there's 1h25 left...
