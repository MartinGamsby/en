### **You don't know what you don't know (Obviously)**

One of the biggest problems of all of the health issues that are plaguing the world right now is when people:

- don't know what being fit feels like
- don't know what eating healthy feels like
- don't know what sleeping well feels like
- don't know what NOT using alcohol/cigarettes feel like

Some people do know, and they remember, but not that much.

They forgot, really.

Some people never got to experience it.

But if everyone got (immediately) from everything going well, to their current state, they would want to go back to being healthy.

But they forgot.

But they don't know...
