### **Your job is not your identity**

- Being tall is not an identity
- Being short is not an identity
- Being pro-Trump is not an identity
- Being anti-Trump either
- Liking music is not an identity
- Being smart is not an identity

Don't get me wrong: These things can be important for you.
They can be part of you you are (IN THIS MOMENT)

- But 
- things 
- change
- You change
- People change
- The world changes

And there is not ONE thing that is YOU

You are you

Doing software is not my identity, and their job shouldn't be the identity of anyone

Even if you do it in your free time, still not an identity

- Do things
- Like things
- Love things
- Embrace things
- Same for hobbies
- Same for people
- Same for jobs
- Same for all

But don't get attached

Identity is not forged on one single thing, and not at one moment either.
