### **Start to finish**

Let me explain:

It is vital to have specific goals and to organize yourself to achieve them.

No matter what your goal is, if you have confidence you can achieve it… but on one condition:

take the first step.

Even if you don’t know where to start, and you’ve been thinking about it for hours, it’s not by thinking about it for hours that you’re going to have an illumination.

It’s not by thinking about a math problem that you’re going to find the solution.

You MUST try to find the solution.

It’s not by thinking about a problem with your spouse that it’s going to be resolved.

You MUST talk about it.

I repeat: even if you don’t know where to start, do something, no matter what it is.

You may be impressed by the speed of results after a simple phone call, a simple draft.

Even if you find the first step insignificant, useless, or even unpleasant, it is essential, and the other steps will come almost by themselves.

You will see your goal advance more quickly, which will give you enthusiasm and energy, which will give more results, therefore more enthusiasm on your part, and so on.

### Why is it so simple?

By focusing on doing a specific task, you focus **concretely** on your goal.

By thinking only about the means of doing it, you also think about the obstacles that could prevent you from doing it.

So, you always tell yourself that you might not succeed, you delay the start, and finally you REALLY risk failing.

The sooner you start, the sooner you will gain confidence in achieving your goal.

In short, be optimistic, and do not put it off until tomorrow, you will only be more optimistic.

I know some people who are hopeless causes, and despite my many attempts to cheer them up, they continue to put themselves down.

This is unfortunate, and I sincerely hope that this is not your case, and that you will do the opposite from now on:

- be optimistic
- love every moment
- don't put it off
- put your favorite quotes into practice

> Life offers us everything but gives us nothing.
