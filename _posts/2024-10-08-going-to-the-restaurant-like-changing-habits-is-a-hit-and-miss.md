### **Going to the restaurant (like changing habits) is a hit-and-miss**

I'll never be able to enjoy any restaurant again, and it's not even entirely because of the food, it's because of the people...

If I go to the restaurant, I have to go where they offer a gluten-free option.

Not because I want to.

If I get traces of gluten, I get sick.

If I get more, I get really sick, not flu-sick, but sick to the point of not feeling my skin, and having trouble walking.

Anyway, I need a gluten-free option.

But most places don't really care.

I don't even know if I'll be sick, even if it's advertised as gluten-free.

I don't know who I'll get:

Who's
- cleaning
- cooking the food
- preparing the plates
- making sure nothing is contaminated

It's probably an employee that couldn't care less.

> Nobody's gonna know, they say...

Well I will, but I won't know who you are, so you're right, nobody will know that you messed up.

And it'll continue.

The only places where it's not a hit-an-miss, it's where it's either:

- A gluten-free place (entirely)
- An owner really cares, and does it himself, everyday (talking from experience)

Unfortunately that's really rare. I'll just have to cook my own food more often.

The good thing is: it's never been so easy to cook my own food, since I'm forced to!

If you want to stop something bad for you, the best way is if you can't do it anymore. If it doesn't happen to you like it did for me, find a way to force it and make your change inevitable.
