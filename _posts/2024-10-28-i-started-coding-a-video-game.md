### **I started coding a video game**

I've been thinking about it for years.

I don't really know why I waited so long.

It's not because I don't know how to do it.

I made my first game when I was 11, with a game designer.

Then I learned to code applications without a game designer.

And then games.

But then I started going to school to program.

Then I got a job in software development.

And I pretty much stopped making games. I just did small projects.

After having a daughter, I pretty much stopped making software projects.

When I had my second daughter, I stopped all my projects, software or otherwise.

And now I'm slowly starting to integrate activities again.

Like writing.

And starting today, a game.

Let's see if I continue...

But in hindsight, I should have started again before.

Please start before you are ready.
