### **Stop hustling, enjoy chores**

I would 100% rather have fully booked days, full of chores. For 50 years.

Rather than having to work 30 years and scramble chores, hustling, burning out, never being fully satisfied during that time, and then not having to do chores for the next 20 (and probably being bored).

Enjoy your mundane chores.

You probably don't need to work THAT hard at your job. You most likely don't need more than one job either.

You also don't need to start a business, but that's another idea entirely.

If you have trouble doing it because you feel overwhelmed, you "just" have to add habits to your life.

For people with ADHD, know that the circuits in the brain related to habits are not affected by it. It's harder to get new habits or break bad habits, but once it's done, it's there for good.

Habits are the most important part of having a healthy lifestyle (physical AND mental), and it's a complex subject that I can't summarize in 250 words. The best resource that I found on the subject is Atomic Habits, for its concrete action steps.

The most important one (in my opinion) being that you need to change your identity. You're not doing chores, you're someone that enjoys the little things in life. And everytime you do it, you cast a vote for that identity. Every time you skip a simple chore, you cast a vote for your identity as a messy person.

Stop casting votes for your identity that is always busy.
