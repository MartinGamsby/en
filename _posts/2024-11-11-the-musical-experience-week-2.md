### **The Musical Experience - Week 2**

Second week of part-time coding, the game can now generate semi-random music.

It's pretty ugly, but it's a start, I'll have to go find my tests from 7 years ago, adapt them and add my new musical knowledge to make better music.

But first, I'll make the experience a game, so that the user can understand and compose music while having fun.

A lot of "backend" work (that means: that can't be seen) this week.
For example, the translation part.
