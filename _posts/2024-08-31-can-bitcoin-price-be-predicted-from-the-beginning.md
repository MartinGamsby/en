### **Can Bitcoin Price Be Predicted, From the Beginning?**

I made a model of the price of Bitcoin.

I have always found the models either very approximate or too localized (they only work “after the first bull run”, “the first years do not count”).

But if the first years don't count... Why would it work in the next few years?

And if there is a huge range (“between 10 thousand and 1 million!!”), then what’s the point…

Anyway, I tried to do it myself.

After the current date, the model gets more and more approximate, but I never use data that is AFTER the date of the estimation.

In other words, adding data will not change past estimates, only future estimates.

So... that gives a peak of around **$300,000** (by the way, that's US dollars, because that's what is most often used for the value of bitcoin), around August 2025.

Obviously: "Past performance is no guarantee of future results."

It's just for fun, it doesn't mean anything...
