### **Web 5.0**

**1.0**: data goes in one direction only: from the website to the user.

**2.0**: data goes in both directions: Internet users can interact with websites.

**3.0**: we don't talk about it... it's marketing. The "cloud" and social networks, which are not an innovation in themselves, but simply another way of presenting what already existed, daydreaming in the clouds.

**4.0**: first interactions with the real world and the senses: the addition of virtual reality, augmented reality and sometimes 3D printers. All this accelerated by the first innovation in terms of input devices after the keyboard and mouse: Eye tracking, the bidirectional interaction of sight; the understanding of the eyes by the computer.

**5.0**: Intersens. What BrainView is preparing: interaction with others, via the senses, even before writing, even before speech. Directly by thought.

> (FICTION) Guide for: * Web 5.0 * : taken from the novel **Interverti**
