### **I just watched "the Martian" - Humanity saving a stranded astronaut**

It's nice seeing so many people trying to save one person.

The whole world is rooting for NASA to save him.

They're deploying all they can.

They're spending a lot.

#### I'm just wondering...

Why don't we have so many people trying to save the thousands dying everyday from preventable causes?

I mean sure, go try and save the guy, but he knew it could happen.

It makes me think of the quote:
#### "The future is already here â€“ it's just not evenly distributed." 
from  William Gibson

Modern civilisation is just really bad at prioritizing what resources should be allocated to (well who am I kidding: the civilisation throughout all of history) 

Maybe we should try to rethink where we currently allocate resources, before deploying more on other things.
