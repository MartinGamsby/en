### **Mathematician**

Nowadays, in school, mathematics is necessary, for many good reasons. The problem is that only a tiny fraction of students are interested in it. As a result, grades are low, so teachers lower the level, since they think it is too difficult, which only makes the course less interesting and less liked. 

The real problem is not the difficulty, it is the mentality of the students when they enter the course. How many times do you hear a student boast that he is the worst in his class in mathematics, that he is not cut out for it, that he will never understand. The problem is that it should not be pride that he demonstrates, but a cry for help. The majority of students are now convinced that they are incapable of doing mathematics, when they simply gave up a long time ago, when they heard another student boast about his false inability to reason.
