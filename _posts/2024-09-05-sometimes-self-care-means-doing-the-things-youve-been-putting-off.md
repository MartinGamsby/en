### **Sometimes self-care means doing the things you've been putting off.**

Spas, massages, relaxations, getaways, campsites, walks, meditation, yoga, relaxation.

Thatâ€™s all good.

You have to do it. Maybe even plan some, if you have trouble doing enough.

On the other hand, sometimes it is better to do important tasks that you do not want to do.

Do your taxes.

Do your workout.

Make your budget.

Make your will.

Clean your room.

#### Everything that's important that isn't done 
takes up space in your head.

Release it.

One of the best ways to know if something is important is when you don't want to do it.

#### Ask yourself 
how you will feel if this thing is done.

Ask yourself if you are overestimating how long it would take to do it.

Because part of your brain is there to protect you. It's there to stop you from doing difficult things that don't have a good return on investment. But you know when it's worth it, you have to convince this primitive part of your brain, summon it to a duel if necessary.

When this is done, your relaxation techniques will be much more effective.
