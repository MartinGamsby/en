### **Type 3 diabetes? You probably have it**

But there's something to do about it!

Some call Alzheimer's "Type 3 diabetes".

It starts in your 20s, so you probably have it.

#### Unless you:

1. Exercise everyday
    - and high intensity a few times a week
2. Eat healthy
    - that means AT LEAST no added sugar
3. Sleep well
    - to remove the trash accumulating in your brain during the day
