### **Meditation is easy, actually.**

The #1 thing that I learned from [Chade-Meng Tan](https://x.com/chademeng) is that meditation is not just one thing.

One single breath can be meditation.

You also don't need to meditate in the lotus position.

#### You can even meditate while walking!

No excuses. Do it now and breathe, consciously, just breathe, nothing else.
