### **No more hiccup**

You've heard multiple ways to stop the hiccup.

- Stop breathing 
- Drink water
- Get scared
- Swallow dry, granulated sugar
- Public speaking
- Some people like to pinch

I've noticed that all the remedies have something in common.

That something is ... 

### surviving.

So let's imagine that you have the hiccup riiiiiiight when you're swallowing water.

Like the actual action of it, when there's water in your esophagus?

What happens if you do get the hiccup right there?

You'd probably choke yourself, and possibly â€¦ drown.

Your body is not that stupid.
It would never allow that.

So when you're swallowing, when your muscles are contracting ... then you can't hiccup.

### You need to use that reflex

That reflex of "not dying", to fix your hiccup.

And all of the "cures" for hiccup have that in common:

get in a state where if you have a hiccup, you die.

### if you're scared enough

then your body won't allow you to have the hiccup, because if there's like a predator that's coming, either the
predator comes faster to you, or he sees you, etc.

But the easiest thing to do is to 

### drink.

you can swallow and when the action of actually swallowing, when you actually contract the muscle, then you're fine.

But it's really hard to maintain that muscle active.

The easiest way is to drink water.

And when you drink water, you focus on when you have this contraction of your muscle.

And when you do it long enough, then it gets longer between the hiccups.

And your hiccup is going away.

People have other ways, for example they can kind of feel the hiccup coming and then they swallow just before they feel the
hiccup coming. And it's still the same trick.

Simply override your body's hiccup glitch, with your body's survival instincts (which has higher priority).
