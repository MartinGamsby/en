### **Goldfish**

Everyone seems to agree that goldfish are stupid and that they only have a 3-second memory. These people would be disappointed to know the memory time of humans, barely higher. 

A few seconds too. 

But there is long-term memory that compensates for this deficiency, fooling us into thinking that we remember everything. This memory, goldfish also have it, and are in fact superior to most other fish. They can even recognize people in the room, just by the sound of their footsteps, making the water vibrate in their aquarium.
