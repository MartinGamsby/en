### **The Musical Experience - Week 1**

After a week of coding, the game can generate midi files, and play them, but not with the usual bad midi sound, with better sounds for instruments.

I started a small interface.

I should find a name eventually.

I was thinking of "Music experience" and maybe put the words together, but it's too weird "Musexperience" :D

The goal of the game, it will be to experiment how music works, to make assisted pieces of music.

Here is the classic onestop.mid: https://youtu.be/ywfMC6pgrrk

OneStop - The "Bohemian Rhapsody" of MIDI - NOT the default player

Most MIDI players sound like crap, here we're using MuseScore's amazing SoundFount.

If you've never heard onestop, you're in for a treat.
