### **Being a parent is easy**

Parenting is not hard in itself.

I mean ... you can be a father and literally never see the child.

But obviously we're talking about actually taking care of your child.

But are we?

Parenting is hard because there's no limit.

There's an infinity of options, from inexistent parent to helicopter parent.

And even though any dumbass can be a parent, what's hard is being a GREAT parent.

It's hard if you care.

If you don't care, you can do the minimal possible, and you'll still be considered a parent.

And being the best parent you can, can make other areas of your life crumble, because you care too much and forget yourself. Forget others.
