### **Grand Metropolitan**

What a ridiculous name. Since the Great Reputation (also really original), names have to match what they really are. To avoid misrepresentation (especially in often misleading advertisements). Obviously, only a few days after the event, a few scammers found loopholes and we were back to square one, with the added bonus of names that would make you want to sleep outside.

And we owe this brilliant idea to the United States. First of all, United States is a pretty simple name, and it represents what it is. But the idea comes from Manhattan, where there is the largest urban grid. At least it was for a long time. This grid, where there were no street names. Only numbers and avenues. So, a simple street and avenue number, and we know where to find the place very easily, like in a Cartesian map.

This Great Reputation gave its name to BrainView, the company I work for. No language restrictions in this Great Reputation. This is also one of these flaws: some words from other languages ​​are written as in English, but mean something else in another language.
