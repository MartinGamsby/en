### **Fabulator**

Human beings have an incredible brain. They are capable of great things. So much so that sometimes they imagine themselves to be better than they really are. When faced with a difficult choice or an irrational desire, the brain will invent a rational story to give a reason to this desire. See the old texts “l'espèce fabulatrice” by Romain Gary.
