### **Hypocritical**

Hypocrisy, in short, is saying something and then thinking something else. This behavior can be practiced by almost anyone, even those who claim to be victims of it, sometimes doing it without even realizing it. For example, some people say they are altruistic, because they help people in need, but what they do borders on uselessness. They then complain that others should be more altruistic, even if what they do is very similar: nothing. 

Colton says that it is part of human regression, that it happens more and more often, too often, to the point where the Earth will no longer support the lack of action of these selfish inhabitants.
