### **Vegetables and meat**

That's all I ate for 2 weeks.

Sometimes I added a bit of olive oil.
Maybe a few nuts.

But everything outside of vegetables and meat was a risk.

I needed to remove as much variety as possible to know what was wrong.

Because everytime I ate, I felt bad, really bad.

Every.
Single.
Time.

Can you imagine being scared of eating?

Sometimes I wanted to stop...

And when I didn't eat for a day, I felt great. But I had to eat.

Here's what I learned:

## 1
You might have something that your body rejects, wrecking your intestines and body, and NOT KNOW about it!

Sometimes there's no symptoms, or very few, and then comes a breaking point later in life.


## 2
If you're sensitive to something, you might get the same symptoms even when you DON'T eat it.

If you eat something you're sensitive to regularly, one meal without it can trigger the same symptoms.

Because your body is hyper reactive.

You need around 2 weeks without it to know for sure that your body calmed down.

(That's why I was reacting to every single thing I ate)


##  3
unless you're very, very, very unlucky, you can eat vegetables and meat for 2 weeks to reset.

Then eat one thing at a time to see who is the culprit.

But...


## 4
it's really hard to stop eating everything, and adding one at a time, limiting yourself.

So maybe instead of adding things one a time, try eliminating one thing at a time.

For example:

1. 1-2 weeks meat and vegetables
2. 1 week with your previous diet minus ONE thing
3. Go back to step 1 every time the symptoms come back and eliminate something else.


## 5
some things are EVERYWHERE.

It took me more than a year doing the previous dance to find out that my issue was with gluten.

Because I thought I tried it early on, but I DIDN'T.

There's gluten everywhere...

In pepperoni, sausages, many sauces, even some cheeses.

Even better: sometimes it's not even in the ingredients, it doesn't say it "may contain traces of wheat", but it does.

For example in oatmeal, it's usually contaminated with wheat, but only from the fields, so they don't have to say it!
##6
dont give up!

And look elsewhere. 

I had issues with food, but with my neck too, an osteopath fixed half my issues that SEEMED related to food
