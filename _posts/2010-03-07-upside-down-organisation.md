### **Upside down organisation**

Can organisation be messy?

Yes.

As I said before, your two hemispheres do not work in the same way, and one of them may be dominant.

If it is your right hemisphere, then you will not have too many problems, it likes the so-called "classic" organisation, the conventional organisation.

If, on the other hand, it is your left hemisphere, you probably have difficulty organizing yourself properly with the methods we learn at school.

Never mind, you will now know how to do it, or rather rediscover a method that you used long before.

Indeed, recently, I cleaned out my old papers, and I did not miss my school papers (my mother wants me to keep them, I do not really know why... but there we are straying a little from the subject).

I discovered something that I had completely forgotten existed, but that helped me enormously at the time.

What was it?

A tiny piece of paper: a memory aid for an oral presentation I had to give.

And what was special about it?

There were NO WORDS!

We are so used to making summaries, then summaries of summaries, then keywords of summaries to make memory aids, that we have forgotten the essential: a picture is worth a thousand words.

But be careful, I am not telling you to make memory aids, or anything in pictures. If that suits you, great, but that is far from being the case for everyone.

In fact, what I saw on my old memory aid sheet was a series of symbols and images whose meaning I currently have no idea.

And that's why you shouldn't put stupid images: you'll forget their meaning and their interactions with each other over time.

Which is not the case with what I'm going to suggest to you.

The best thing is a so-called photographic memory.

You make a diagram, symbols, images if you want, key words, etc.

Anything that comes to mind, in any order, in any direction.

Now, what is the advantage of the methods taught?

The advantage is that you can take a "photo" of this page that you have made.

Once again, be careful, it can take practice (even if young people are usually capable, and with age we lose the habit), and the results are better with smaller "photos", and must ABSOLUTELY be made by you.

So as I said, you can take a photo, precisely because they are not just words.

You can remember the shape of your diagram, the layout of your pictures, and so the words you wrote on it will simply come back to you and visualize that picture when you need it.

I know, there are not many details on how to do it, and it may seem difficult at first glance, but I hope at least it has helped some people.

To use something other than paper, you can also use the Freemind software to make simple mind maps on the computer.
