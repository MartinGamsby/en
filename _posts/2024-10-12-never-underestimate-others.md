### **Never underestimate others**

For several reasons, but especially when someone has more experience than you.

- Read the instruction manual
- Ask for help at the hardware store
- Listen to your parents (at any age)
- Take lessons

For example, I started taking piano lessons.

I started playing piano a long time ago, about 15 years, and learned a few songs by heart.

But now that I’m taking lessons, I’m progressing much faster.

The #1 reason, the most important one, is actually very simple: I don’t want to show up to the next lesson without having practiced.

You can use this feeling of not wanting to disappoint someone to your advantage.

It’s used for all sorts of things, often in the form of an "accountability partner."

But when it’s a teacher, or someone who knows more than you, you also get all the other benefits: shortcuts, advice, and so on.

This person has already made all the mistakes you’re going to make, and you could avoid them by really listening.

Because assuming to know better than someone else "makes an **a✴✴** out of **u** and **me** ", and it's never useful...
