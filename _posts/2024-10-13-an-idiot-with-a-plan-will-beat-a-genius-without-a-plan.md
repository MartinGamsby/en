### **An idiot WITH a plan, will beat a genius WITHOUT a plan**

Planning is the most underrated part of ... everything (almost!)

The problem is that too much planning is also bad.

But too much of anything is bad, so it's not an excuse.

Plan everything and anything, maybe it'll even make you reconsider even making the thing in the first place, and save you time.

And when I say everything, it includes planning time with your loved ones.

Start with that.
