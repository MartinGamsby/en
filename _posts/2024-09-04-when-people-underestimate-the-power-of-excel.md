### **When People Underestimate the Power of Excel**

I saw a Microsoft ad, showing Excel, in 1990.

In summary, they demonstrate that Excel can extend data, creating projections from trends.

Well, in 1990, not everyone knew, 17 years ago.

But in the comments, I saw someone reply “and he’s still the only one who knows how to do it”.

I shouldn't have, but I responded saying that it was actually very simple to do with Excel, and I got responses saying that I must be the type to rely on computers to do my job in my place, or something like that.

And uh... yes. It's my job.

We are talking about automatically doing 10%, twice. No solving a difficult problem with a spreadsheet.

Anyway, I did it on video. Here it is: https://youtu.be/D0Cs1Qmn5FE
