### **Déjà Vu**

"Déjà vu" are actually brain reconstructions of a similar situation that has already happened, since storing all the details would be useless and too costly for our lazy, or rather oportunist, body. So it's nothing special, it's not a premonition, nor a special power, and it's not spiritual. It's just a "brain fart".
