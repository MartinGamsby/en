### **Conference**

This term may seem outdated, but this trend has gained momentum again, since only real-world training is allowed for the annual continuing education tax credit, since the training scandal a few years ago. For those who are wondering what it is, a conference is essentially a video training, but not on the Internet... 

Why the government prefers this to a good old time-lapse video full of information, I don't know, they don't mention their intentions anywhere. Go see Djosh Sho's conferences at the new Conference Center of the Greater Metropolis. 

> (FICTION) Guide for: * Conference * : from the novel **Interverti**
