### **Why is the sky blue? (And everything else)**

It finally happened.

My daughter asked me to tell her “everything I know”.

I did the same thing to my father, and now I have to explain that it's impossible to say “everything you know” at once.

She paused, then replied, “Then tell me 5 things a day.”

She's one step ahead of me...

I have no problem telling her 5 things a day, but it's hard to decide what. I told her she has to ask me the questions, but she finds it difficult. Sometimes she takes several minutes to “think about her question.”

It took a few weeks, but I finally had the cliché question: “why is the sky blue”.

I knew this question was coming, but I still didn't have a good, ready-made answer.

I want my answers to be correct, so I gave her a choice: Do you want the answer to be my interpretation, or are we getting a complete answer on the Internet?

The complete answer.

I think this whole process will help her find the right questions to ask, find good sources when she’s not sure, and stay curious.

On the other hand, my other daughter is less sure of herself, she is anxious. So it wouldn't work as well for her. We need to adapt to our children, and if she always has to decide, it will give her too much pressure, and she will freeze when it comes to other aspects of life.

Listen.
