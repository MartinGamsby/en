### **My teacher's secret**

One day, my Spanish teacher told me how he learned vocabulary.

To learn at a reasonable speed, he set himself a goal: learn 3 vocabulary words or 2 verbs per day. To do this, he wrote these words or verbs on a piece of paper on the refrigerator!

That was very clever of him. His reasoning was as follows: if I want to learn something, I have to see it often to remember it, and he was right on this point, since he was at the final 20% stage of his French learning.

[Remember Pareto's law?](https://martingamsby.github.io/en/why-80-of-wealth-belongs-to-20-of-people-and-why-it-matters-for-everything)

And what are we sure to see at least 3 times in a day? A refrigerator of course.
