### **Sleeper**

The miracle "recipe" to fall asleep quickly. I feel a little ridiculous for not having noticed it before, but I finally found a crucial point to fall asleep. Yes, there are the things that all insomniacs in this world know: exercising helps, but it's hard; going to bed and waking up always at the same time helps, but I love staying in bed in the morning. 

But I finally found something easy to do. A little "sad", but not so hard for what it brings. It's simple: don't eat "pure" sugar, no empty calories before going to bed. And it's the same if you want to lose weight, so if you have a few extra pounds, stop eating sugar after dinner and you kill two birds with one stone!

If you're hungry, you may be lacking water. Often, when you're "hungry", it's just a lack of water in your metabolism. Drink 4 large glasses of water every day. One when you get up if possible.
