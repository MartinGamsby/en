### **Stop eating crap food. Stop normalizing what the food industry wants**

It's not "easier than before" to eat gluten free, or anything healthy

If your great grandmother was celiac, she just noticed she couldn't eat bread and stopped.

Done. Easy.

Now, you can't only do that because it's everywhere.

It's in every meal, every side meal, every condiment.

Because it's cheap and acts like glue.

Yes, it's easier to get gluten free than 30 years ago, but 80 years ago, it was already all gluten free (except the obvious bread, pasta and cake and all)

We ate real food, stop normalizing crap food, the food industry only wants profit, not your health.

If they can get you addicted it's a bonus for them.

Eat real food, even if it costs a bit more, it's the only way to make them stop make crap food.
