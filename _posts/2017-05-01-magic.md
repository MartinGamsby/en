### **Magic**

If magic existed, we would call it science. Magic is just a mystery. If it is debunked (and it always is), it loses its magical status and becomes science, or a visual trick - an illusion - that has been perfected with scientific methodology. In this sense, either magic does not exist, or it is everywhere. It is up to you to decide.
