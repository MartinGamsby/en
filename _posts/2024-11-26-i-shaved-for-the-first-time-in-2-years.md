### **I shaved for the first time in 2 years**

It had been 2 years since I shaved.

I was afraid of my nerves.

Would I feel a cut and keep going too hard, too long?

Probably not.

Would my muscles move the right way? The way I want them to move?

Probably not.

But today, I have confidence again.

I will move my hands the right way. I will not hurt myself without knowing it.

My nerves are fine, and I didn't even think about it before.

But today, I am grateful.

Thank you, my nerves.
