### **Ah, the holiday season (one tourtière at a time)**

In Quebec, a holiday custom is to eat tourtière.

On the evening of the 24th, it’s very good, the next morning too… by noon we’re starting to get tired of it, in the evening it almost becomes torture, and the next day we eat it by force so as not to waste the leftovers.

Tourtière is very good, but after eating it for 5 meals in a row, it’s hard to swallow.

To start eating it again and want to eat it, it takes a few months, or even the whole year, until the next holiday.

Having eaten only one or two meals, I could have eaten it again just a week later, this week for example, without feeling forced to do so.

I could have appreciated the taste and flavour, but right now I’m incapable of doing so.

This has certainly happened to you.

Not necessarily for tourtière.

But being unable to eat something you loved before you ate 5 meals in a row is normal.

Well, do you know what, your brain acts the same way.

Even if you love learning and surpassing yourself, if you only do that, after a few days you will be unable to do it, due to lack of... desire, which you had in industrial quantities at the start.

If you like something, an abundance will bore you.

Imagine if you don't like it at the start... go away.

However, this is what most people do when they want to learn.

They don't want to learn, don't like learning, but try to do everything at once, to "get rid of it".

If they manage to get through it, not only will they not have had good results, but they will also not want to learn anything for days, even weeks or months.

You must spread out your learning, and above all diversify it.

The best, of course, would be if you liked learning, but if that is not the case, tell yourself that even those who like learning can also be "disgusted" with doing it if they do not manage their time well.

I am not saying that you should stop learning to learn better. Personally, I only do it when I have to.

What you need to do is diversify your learning.

Besides, I admit that on this point, the school has understood it well.

To take the example of tourtières: when you are disgusted with eating them, do you stop eating too?

Of course not, you eat something else.

Start by learning a subject, then change, before having an "overdose" if possible.

If you feel your concentration diminishing, change the subject.

If you go through several subjects in an hour, think about going to sleep, or relaxing.

Trust me, you won't waste any time, even if you're in a hurry.
