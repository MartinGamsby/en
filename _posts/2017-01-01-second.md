### **Second**

The unit of time can be difficult for children to understand. Why do an hour of sleep, an hour in the car and an hour of play seem to be hours that have a completely different duration? Because of the perception of time that is different. There are too many factors to know what is happening in the marvel of complexity that is our brain.

But when we talk about time to children, a question comes up. A question that almost no adult asks, because “that’s just the way it is”: why does a second last a second? Why this unit of time? Why 24 hours, 60 minutes, 60 seconds… Obviously, no one was there to know, but according to Colton, the second comes from the only thing our ancestors had access to: themselves. Indeed, the average heartbeat speed is about 60 beats per minute, or… one per second. Each hour is therefore made up of 3600 heartbeats.
