### **An idea you can apply to everything, from 20 years of learning**

I just hit a 20 days streak.

For exercise, and writing.

I feel much better, and like I accomplished a lot more than what I thought 20 days could do, but only 20 days works wonders.

But I couldn't have gotten here without doing one day at a time.

I've been thinking about this concept...

In the last 20 years, I have consumed a lot of personal development content.

Books
Videos
Training
Courses
Podcasts
Seminars
...
I'm a bit ashamed to tell you how much it cost me (ok it's 5 digits)

And there are some core ideas.

The one that always comes is: "One at a time".

It might seem stupid said like that, but it isn't.

It's simple, yes.

That's the point

But it's the core of
EVERY
SINGLE
ADVICE

Name any personal development book, I can tell you how it applies.

New habits?
One day at a time

Finances?
One dollar at a time

Decluttering?
One item at a time

Health?
One meal at a time
One rep at a time

And the list goes on...

I'm even tempted to write a book on it, since it's such a profound idea ...
