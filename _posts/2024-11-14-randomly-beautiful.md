### **Randomly beautiful**

In 2017, I created something to generate music, but it’s not quite as I expected it to be.

Here’s an example:

But the problem is … I don’t have a way to know if the music created is good or not (apart from listening to it myself).

So, I decided to take the problem from the bottom and measure a music’s “beauty”.

But that seemed a little hard also, just because it’s hard to “visualize”, because you know, it’s music.

So, I started checking if I could measure the beauty of images, and start from there to learn how to learn if music is beautiful or not… which started Sceauty (Scientific Beauty)

and ... I stopped that too. Let's say that having 2 kids takes a bit of free time.

Anyway, I started again, and I'll take these old ideas, improve them, add more, with some musical theory (that I didn't really have at the time).
