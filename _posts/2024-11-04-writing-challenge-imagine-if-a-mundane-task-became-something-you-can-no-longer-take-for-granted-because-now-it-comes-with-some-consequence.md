### **Writing challenge: imagine if a mundane task became something you can no longer take for granted, because now it comes with some consequence**

Donut day
Pizza party
Bagel treat
Hot-dogs Barbecue

These are all gone now.
Worse, they're not gone, they're just tempting me.

Everyone does it.
Everyone asks.
Everyone.
But not me.

Eating these makes it hard to breathe.

makes it hard to walk.
want to puke.

hard to live.
