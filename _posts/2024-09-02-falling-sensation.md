### **Falling sensation**

You know that feeling when you swing too high.

Or on the roller coaster, or in the car, or in the elevator.

My kids say it “tickles their taste buds,” and I think that’s the best description I’ve ever heard.

(Because I've never heard a name for this phenomenon...)

#### Did you know
 that this sensation is due to the fact that your stomach no longer feels the effect of gravity, so your body doesn't really know how to react to this information, which almost never happens.

So it’s a feeling of “I don’t understand what’s happening with my stomach”.

#### Did you also know 
that Einstein developed his famous theory of relativity using this phenomenon: for an observer in free fall from the roof of a house, there is during the fall - at least in its immediate vicinity - no gravitational field.
