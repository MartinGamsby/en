### **Less organisation for better performance?**

Before I begin, I don’t want you to make me say what I didn’t say: organisation is necessary to perform well.

Some people need more organisation than others, but everyone, without exception, has some form of organisation.

So the question is not whether you need to have organisation to save time, but what type you need.

### Which part of you dominates you?

First of all, you should know that our brain is designed to be able to function at 100% even if the two halves are separated.

I think this is the case for schizophrenics: their two hemispheres no longer communicate, but since that’s not the subject, I won’t talk about it any more.

So we have two hemispheres working together, but can work very well alone. Result: one of the two hemispheres is dominant.

### Why are we interested in this?

Because each hemisphere has a different "way of thinking", and each person does not have the same hemisphere that dominates.

- Your left hemisphere, which controls the right part of your body, is called "artistic", since it is the one that controls your emotions, and everything that is not rational.
- Your right hemisphere, controlling the left part of your body, you guessed it, is more Cartesian (realistic, logical). So it is the one that tells you to classify everything to find your way more easily later.

But be careful, it is not because your right hemisphere wants to classify everything that it is the most effective for you. 
Indeed, your left hemisphere has its own classification.

So there is the ordered classification and the "disordered" classification. I know that disordered classification is contradictory, but I will explain to you what it is and you will understand.

Depending on your way of thinking, you will understand with only one of your hemispheres, or both…

P.S. I will explain the “disordered classification” next time, and a test to know if you have found a good way to organize yourself efficiently according to your dominant hemisphere afterwards.
