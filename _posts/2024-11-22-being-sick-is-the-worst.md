### **Being sick is the worst**

Being sick 

- screws your schedule
- screws your habits
- screws your chores
- screws you

...


And you just have to rest, sleep and recover.

But don't let sickness linger for too long.

I don't mean "don't be sick for too long", I mean "get back up as fast as possible"

As soon as you can, get back on track.

- One chore at a time
- One Task at a time
- One day at a time

Get back (or to) an equilibrium, don't be late on everything.
