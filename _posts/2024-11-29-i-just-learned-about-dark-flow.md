### **I just learned about Dark Flow**

I was thinking (and calculating) about this idea that the big bang is a humongous black hole that exploded.

And that our "universe" is surrounded by other similar black holes.

So it makes me think that it's perhaps  just that.

Dark flow is (in summary) a bunch of galaxies that are attracted by something that is outside of the observable universe.

And ... well that's basically what I was talking about.
