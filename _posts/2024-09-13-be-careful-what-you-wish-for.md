### **Be careful what you wish for**

When we get something, we want it less.

It happened to me with software.

I now know that I could do anything.

Automate anything.

Sometimes I do, but it also gave me the urge to go back to our roots (as a species).

Like farming.

As many devs did before me...

It's surprisingly common, there's memes of it and all...

(If anyone knows who I can credit for this meme, please tell me!)
