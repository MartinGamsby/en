### **A love-hate relationship?**

Learning a new language is difficult.

Because you don't understand everything. Because you don't know everything. 

I think that's the similarity between hating yourself, and hating a programming language : You don't know it well at first.

Maybe if you hate yourself... You donâ€™t know yourself very well? 

Getting to know yourself puts things into perspective.
