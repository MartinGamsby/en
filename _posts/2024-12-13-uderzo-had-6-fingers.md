### **Uderzo had 6 fingers**

Having 6 fingers at birth is surprisingly frequent.

Yet you probably don't know someone that is born with 6 fingers.

Or they never told you.

Before the Internet, you might even believe that it's not true.

But it is...

That doesn't mean you should believe everything you see on the Internet.

Sometimes unbelievable things are true, and very believable things are not.

We are really bad at knowing that, intuitively, be careful.
