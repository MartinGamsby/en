### **Parents are adapting**

I used to think that children had to adapt to their parents.

Now that I'm a parent, I know it's the opposite.

Not all parents understand this, but it's what needs to happen.

The role of the parent is not to model the child, but to support him.

And the child has characteristics that may be completely different from the parents.

And the child should not transform into his parent, but the parent should adapt to their child.

I’m thinking about things like fear, but also ambition.

I’m thinking about things like anxiety, but also curiosity.

I can't list everything here, but the parents must adapt.

Other conditions may be more important, more crucial, like autism or ADHD, for example.

And if you don't agree, if you think you can "break your child's ADHD"...

Here's another example:

Let's say your child is born blind.

Are you going to think "it's easy to walk, take things, what's your problem".

No, you're going to see that he's blind, and you're going to learn all sorts of things about it, and you're going to adapt your life to help him.

We don't choose to be blind.

As we do not choose to have personality differences,

differences in neurodivergence,

differences in needs...
