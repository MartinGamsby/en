### **Personalities**

On the Internet, there are 4 types of personalities.
1. "Exploiters": make money on the backs of others.
2. "Exploited": give money to exploiters, or contribute unwittingly, by watching ads on "free" sites.
3. "Altruists": sell real value, would give if they didn't need money to survive... Some don't ask for it anyway.
4. Trolls: Seem to enjoy annoying people.
