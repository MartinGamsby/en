### **I thought I didn't have a dream car...**

But I found one!
My dream car is a car that:

- Doesn't need any kind of fuel/energy
- Goes very fast, without accidents
- Goes at 99% the speed of light
- Or I guess teleports
- Never breaks

I guess my dream car is a free teleporter.

Why are we always limiting ourselves with what's possible?

Before Ford, people wanted faster horses.
