### **Burnout**

To understand how rough the working conditions were at blizzard: 

We worked overtime a ton the pay was not very good.

It was a bad time so I went to Amazon game Studio which is about 4 minutes away from blizzard in Irvine and in my first month I went to my boss and I said:

"Hey, I don't feel like I'm doing very good work I feel like I'm not achieving anything it's starting to weigh on me, cuz I don't feel like I'm getting very much done"

this was a Thursday he said

"take the rest of the day off, take tomorrow off take a 4-day weekend, I'm not taking it out of your PTO, 
I understand what you're feeling right now"

because he was from blizzard and he said

"we were overworked there. This is a normal job, this is the normal amount of hours you work every day and what you're feeling right now is the fact that you don't know how to deal with that. You were overworked for so long that moving at a normal pace feels like you're standing still"

and I was like "Jesus Christ", and I took the four days and I came back and he was totally right, it was one of the best bosses I ever had.
