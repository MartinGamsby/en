### **Intermittent Fasting**

The food industry benefits if you eat. Often. This industry is owned by the only two companies that really exist today, who control everything with their products and marketing. They decide what you eat and when you eat it. Not what is best for you, but rather what is best for their wallet.

When I realized this, I did some research and then I discovered something amazing. In fact, Coal Ton told me about it: until very recently, our ancestors obviously did not have three meals a day, simply because they did not have access to that much food. So, natural selection meant that those who could not survive without eating frequently died out. Extinct. So logically, we are designed not to eat regularly. In fact, it has been proven that consciously fasting frequently helps our metabolism, more than gorging ourselves several times a day.

Counterintuitively, fasting for one meal, every other day, can have a beneficial effect on the human body. Many people already do it without realizing it, for example when they have “brunch” on the weekend. Obviously, you don’t have to become anorexic. You have to eat more than usual the meal that is the fast and not exceed this magic number of one meal every two days. Exercising every day should also be included with this practice.
