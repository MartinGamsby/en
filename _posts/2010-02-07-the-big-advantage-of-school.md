### **The BIG advantage of school**

I said bad things about school before, but there is not only bad in the school system, quite the contrary.

What helped me the most, motivated me to continue, gave me a reason to continue, is what is best about school.

Unfortunately, it is not their idea, and many others use it, and rightly so.

Without it, the school would be nothing, and too many things would not be done.

The BIG advantage of school is its schedule.

The schedule is the body of the school.

Without it, the school simply could not exist.

Why?

I come back again to a very important point: the organization.

Indeed, what would a school of 5000 people and hundreds of teachers look like ... without any of them knowing where they should go? When they should go?

It's completely insane.

I’ve said it before, but school NEEDS a schedule to function.

Why wouldn’t a person need one?

After all, a school is just a bunch of people, nothing more.

If you want to save time, you need to make a schedule. (I repeat: you MUST make a schedule)

There are many techniques to do this, which I will try to list over the next few weeks, but the most important thing is that you stick to your schedule.

To do this, I will give you a trick that I use for all my schedules.

To do this, you can simply put one task to do per day, a project you have, something you want to learn, an assignment to do, etc.

Personally, I have multiple tasks per day, even for those who are busy with my schedule provided by the school.

And I apply this trick to it:

Even if you would rather die than do what you wrote on your schedule, even if you are fed up and think you don’t have time.

START and set aside 5 minutes.

Just 5 minutes. That’s less than the time it takes to eat a meal, less than the time you stay in bed pressing the “Snooze” button on your alarm clock.

Start, and do it for 5 minutes.

If after 5 minutes you still don’t feel like continuing, it’s either because you haven’t really applied yourself, or because you need to take your mind off things.

In both cases, it’s probably better that you stop, there’s no point in forcing yourself to do more than 5 minutes.

If you have other tasks, try the 5 minutes one by one, or take breaks.

But remember: 5 minutes can make all the difference and give you the taste and enthusiasm to continue for hours.
