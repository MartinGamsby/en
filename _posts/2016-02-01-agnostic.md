### **Agnostic**

When we think of death, we often think of this tunnel with a white light at the end, as several stories testify. 

This tunnel could be just a last hallucination of the brain lacking oxygen and stimuli. 

There may also be something else after death. The problem is that you have to die to know, and the dead don't argue much. 

The agnostic does not deny any religious or spiritual hypotheses, no matter how far-fetched they may seem. There is simply not enough evidence to know what is true, so the agnostic abstains, giving equal credit to all possibilities, most of the time without practicing any ritual, belief, or superstition. 

On the other hand, most agnostics would like to believe in an entity greater than us, this being one of the differences with atheists, who deny any divinity or higher entity.
