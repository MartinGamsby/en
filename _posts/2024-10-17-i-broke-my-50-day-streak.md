### **I broke my 50 day streak**

Yesterday, I didn't write.

I wrote every day for 50 days before.

I could get discouraged.

I could say to myself "what's the point, I have to start again".

But you know what?

I wrote 50 times more than if I never started.

Not so bad.

The important thing is not to have no hickups.

The important thing is to get back up.

Same thing when the doctors told me they didn't know what I had: I kept looking every day, to achieve what they couldn't do in 20 minutes.

5 minutes a day is always better than 20 minutes once, no matter what you know.
