### **The Musical Experience - Week 5**

Fifth week of part-time coding, the game can now generate music that is a bit more coherent.

Choose the instrument you want, if you want multiple instruments at once, if you want random durations, or if you want to have a chord progression.

This is just a start, but this is what the game should look like, with more options, more story, more things to do.
