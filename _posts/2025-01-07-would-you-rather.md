### **Would you rather:**

- be hungry for the rest of your life, with a guaranteed doubled lifespan.
- continue what you're doing with a guaranteed halved lifespan.

### Guaranteed is the key point 

Because I think most people wouldn't want to sacrifice for future promises, because they're just that: promises.

I heard a lot of times people continuing their bad habits because it would "affect their happiness" or whatever.

### I don't think that's true

I think most people would make the sacrifice for a guaranteed outcome.

And the ones that would not take the guarantee will never be convinced, so we shouldn't bother with them.

Instead of saying "you know that if you keep eating crap, you'll die sooner?", 
(which we know isn't working)
we should have enough metrics to guarantee that something will be good, with a guaranteed outcome.

Like "Eating sugar will give you Alzheimer's in ... 15 years" or "Sleeping less than 7 hours a day will give you depression in ... 5 months".

We're not there yet, but we need to start somewhere.

Thank you Bryan Johnson for increasing awareness on this. (I just watched "Don't Die", go check it out on Netflix)
